# Setup Guide

This integration allows you to map Freeform submission data to [Calendar](https://docs.solspace.com/craft/calendar/v4). In addition to most custom Craft fields, Freeform can also map to the *Title*, *Site ID*, *Slug*, *Author ID*, *Post Date*, *Date Created* and *Date Updated*.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the Integration

- Select *Calendar Events* from the **Service Provider** select dropdown.
- Enter a name and handle for the integration. e.g. `My Calendar Integration`.
- Choose a Calendar from the **Calendar** select dropdown.
    - This will only be the default value when configuring the integration in the form builder later.
- Click the **Save** button.

### 2. Configure the Form

- Open up the form inside the form builder.
- Click on the **Integrations** tab.
- Click on your new **Calendar** integration in the list of available integrations.
- On the right side of the page:
    - Enable the integration.
    - Confirm the calendar in the **Calendar** field, or change it as necessary.
    - The **Attribute Mapping** table allows you to map standard Craft Entry fields.
    - The **Field Mapping** table is where you map Freeform fields to the Calendar fields as needed.
